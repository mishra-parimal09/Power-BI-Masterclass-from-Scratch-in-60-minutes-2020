Power BI is one o the most advanced tools available for data visualization in the industry today. 

With this fact in mind, I went through a course on the application of Power BI and was able to come up with some very intuitive and informative visualizations. The insights which were drawn from the visualizations in minutes which otherwise would have taken quite a time to be realized.

A few features of the Power BI which are integrated in this repository includes:

1. Connections to several kinds of data sources such as excel, SQL server, pdf,

2. Visualization as stacked column chart, radar chart, doughnut chart, pie chart, play axis, scatter plot and many other available on the marketplace,

3. Concept of filters and advanced filters and their usage,

4. Data transformation,

5. Data values calculation,

6. Drill down feature using the hierarchical data,

7. Usage of grouping and binning and their applications,
